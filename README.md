# Unlimita-RPG

## Description

This is my READ ME for the turn based game unlimita rpg. Having played many turn based rpg games I always imagined the workings behind one and how difficult it might be to make one. I wanted to make a simple game that took elements from many rpg adventure games which had turned based mechanics and remove the advenure part to focus on making it a pure turn based strategy game. The player battles with their arch nemesis the slime which gets stronger with each victory for the player. As you defeat enemeies [slimes are our only enemy at the moment] your highscore increases by the number of victories the you achieve. get a highscore by strategically investing points in to your player as you level up to create a character that can take down more powerful slimes.  

## Technologies Used
